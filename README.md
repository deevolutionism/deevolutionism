### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Summary
I'm Gentry, a front end engineer with about 4-5 YoE building apps of various sizes. I've done everything from build and deploy quick microsites using a Vue/Mongo/DigitalOcean stack to contributing to large scale code bases at ASCAP (Backbone, Vue) and GAP (Typescript/React/Node). Proficient in React and Vue and have used various frameworks and libraries such as meteor, backbone, jquery, django, php/wordpress in the past. Recently picked up Typescript + React 16 (learning hooks)! I'd describe myself as constantly curious, always excited about learning new things. 

I prticulaltry enjoy keeping up to date with innovative technologies. Some tech i've recently been playing around with/learning about:

â€¢ Bitcoin â€¢ Ethereum â€¢ Polygon/Matic â€¢ NFTs/EIP-721 â€¢ Nostr â€¢ NeRFs â€¢ ChatGPT â€¢ Stable Diffusion â€¢ MidJourney â€¢ Blender

I'm currently working on a new portfolio site that will include a blog where I'll share more of my experiences/learnings with these various technologies.
